# Go Tutorial

I am trying to learn how to create program in Go. <br>
These codes are files in which one of them I have learned a part of this language.
<br>
<br>

I have classified these files, plus there are many comments.<br>
And the last point is that Go has a lot in common with other languages 
so if you are able to code with languages you can understand this language easily
but remember to search about this language especial abilities and programming paradigm.
